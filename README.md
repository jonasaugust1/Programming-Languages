# Programming-Languages

Do you know when C# was invented? How about your other favorite programming languages, like JavaScript, Ruby, and R?

In this project I used lists and LINQ to search a database for answers!

The data is stored in a .tsv file, which stands for tab-separated values. It’s a common way to export data from a spreadsheet or database — 
you might see this file type when you try to download data from apps like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.

Here is what the data would look like as a table (just a few random rows included):

| Year | #Name |	#Chief | #Developer |	#Predecessors |

| 1990 |	AMOS BASIC |	François | Lionet, Constantin Sotiropoulos	STOS BASIC |
